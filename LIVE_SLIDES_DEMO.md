## 📝 Demo Script (30 seconds)

"Let me show you our Live Slides feature - it's like Google Meet but optimized for education.

As a teacher, I can start a live session with pre-loaded slides. Students join instantly and see exactly what I'm presenting.

Watch as I navigate - the slides sync in real-time across all devices. Students can react with emojis to show understanding or ask questions.

The audio uses Opus codec for crystal-clear voice even on slow connections. No video means less bandwidth and fewer distractions.

Perfect for online lectures, especially in areas with limited internet connectivity."
