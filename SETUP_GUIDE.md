# Educational Platform Setup Guide

## üéØ What We've Built

I've successfully created a comprehensive educational platform similar to Google Classroom with the following features:

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

1. **Database Schema** - Complete Supabase PostgreSQL schema with all necessary tables
2. **College Management** - Registration, dashboard, and user management
3. **User System** - Role-based registration for teachers, students, and admins
4. **Classroom System** - Create/join classrooms with unique codes
5. **Interactive Features** - Assignments, quizzes, polls, and group chat
6. **Backend API** - Express.js server with all educational endpoints
7. **Frontend Components** - React/TypeScript components for all features
8. **Low Bandwidth Optimization** - Voice-only lectures and efficient data transfer

### üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Express.js + Node.js
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Real-time**: Supabase subscriptions
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Deployment Ready**: Vercel/Netlify frontend, Railway/Heroku backend

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Database Setup

1. Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to SQL Editor in your Supabase dashboard
3. Run the migration files in order:
   - First: `supabase/migrations/20250917183947_wandering_field.sql`
   - Then: `supabase/migrations/20250918170000_educational_platform.sql`

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Install backend dependencies
cd server
npm install
cd ..
```

### 4. Start Development Servers

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start frontend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start backend
cd server
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3001
